# Victoria Sponge Cake

## Ingredients
- 4 Eggs
- Stork baking margerine (unsalted butter also works, I prefer marge),
- Caster sugar,
- Icing sugar,
- Self-raising flour (if gluten free, gluten free self-raising flour with
Xantham Gum mixed in),
- Vanilla extract/essence,
- Jam (Strawberry is best),

## Equipment
- Mixing bowl,
- Spatula,
- Two roughly 8" cake tins, 
- Baking paper,
- Electric mixer (optional),
- Kettle,

## Method:
### Sponge:
1. Preheat the oven to gas mark 5 (190 degrees C/170 degrees C Fan).
1. Trace around the cake tins on the baking paper with pencil and cut out two
circles. Then grease the tins with margerine and stick the circles to the bottom
of them.
1. Weigh the eggs, whilst still in their shells. Take a note of the mass (should
be about 240-300g, depending on the eggs). This mass will be referred to
throughout the rest of the recipe as 'x'.
1. Measure x grams of caster sugar and margerine into a mixing bowl, and mix thorougly.
1. Beat the four eggs together thoroughly until bubbly.
1. Measure out x grams of flour into a bowl.
1. Boil the kettle.
1. Add the eggs to the margerine flour mixture gradually on a high speed. When
the mixture starts to get very runny, add some flour, on a slow speed. Repeat
until all the flour and eggs have been added. You should run out of egg first.
1. Add a cap of vanilla essence or extract.
1. Add 2 ish tablespoons of boiling hot water to the mixture and mix through,
1. Quickly, pour the mixture evenly into the two tins, jiggling them about a bit
to get it spread out. Then put in the oven for roughly 25 minutes, until golden
brown and cooked through.
1. Once baked, run a knife around the edge of the tin and transfer to a cooling
rack. Remove the paper from the base of the cake. MAKE SURE THEY COOL BEFORE
DECORATING.

### Decoration:
1. Mix together roughly 30 grams of marge with 60 grams of icing sugar, with
half a cap of vanilla.
1. Spread icing sugar on base of cake.
1. Spread jam on lid of cake
1. Sandwich.
1. Put a bit of icing sugar in a sieve over the mixing bowl. Then bring over the
cake and tap to dust the top.
