# Pasta Carbonara
*Serves 4*

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs,
- 120 - 200g of parmesan Cheese (depending on how cheesy you want it),
- 1 onion, diced.
- A box of mushrooms, peeled and diced.
- Chorizo, cubed or sliced.
- 350g of a pasta of your choice

## Method:
1. Beat the eggs together in a bowl, and add the cheese, grated finely. Season
with salt and pepper.
1. Add pasta to a pan to cook.
1. Add some oil to a pan and heat up.
1. Fry onions until soft.
1. Add chorizo and leave warm for a minute or so.
1. Add mushrooms and allow to reduce.
1. Season (I don't know how to do this part.)
1. Add the cooked pasta to the pan and mix through.
1. Take the pan off the heat and add the sauce. You don't want it to get too hot
too fast to make sure that the egg doesn't scramble, so make sure its mixed
through and offer it up to the heat a little just to make sure its cooked and
hot to serve.
